## Purpose
I have always enjoyed the recommendations Spotify provides for my playlists but sometimes they seem a bit redundant. I am always looking for new music and new artists. Reddit has been a place where I have been able to find songs but it requires some work. 

Spot-It is being developed to reduce the time spent searching Reddit and allow users to spend more time listening. By creating a data pipeline, data warehouse, and developing a recommendation engine, discovering new music will now be easier for users.
